# PyTorch Neural Network

These files are the saved neural network models I used in this research. The training data is available
[here](https://github.com/cics-nd/rans-uncertainty).

*Note*: You need to convert the network model to libtorch file for using it in OpenFOAM (using the [python
script](./pytorchToTorchScript.py)). See [this file](../bnn_OpenFOAM/ReadMe.md), please.
